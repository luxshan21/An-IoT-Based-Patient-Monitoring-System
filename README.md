PROBLEM DEFINED

• Especially when elderly peoples have sudden health issues, there should be a need for the caretaker or 
relative to keep track of their health status. Continuous monitoring of a patient by a healthcare taker is a 
difficult task in the modern world. This could lead to mild to fatal consequences.

PRODUCT GOALS

PURPOSE

• Monitoring the health status of a patient and providing necessary information to the caretaker.

FUNCTIONALITY

• Develop a device to monitor the patient health status periodically. The system collects the patient's health 
data like body temperature, Heart rate, SPO2 level and ECG reading. In addition to that system can measure 
the room temperature, humidity and air quality of the patient’s surrounding environment. All these patient 
data are made available in an online platform to have easy access for the caretaker.

BASIC DESIGN SPECIFICATION

• The device builds as portable and wearable.
• Use OLED to display the health data of the patient. 
• The device can be powered by a rechargeable battery.

HARDWARE COMPONENT FOR BASIC DESIGN

• Node Mcu microcontroller

• ECG sensor

• Pulse oximeter

• Thermometer

• ESP 32 WIFI Module

• Temperature humidity sensor

• OLED Display

• Power supply

INTENDED MARKET SEGMENT

• This is one of the commercial products targeted towards the caretakers and doctors for having 
consistent monitoring of patient’s health state.
• Also, this can be used as a common smart device to provide health data of any individual.
• This product is expected to be introduced to the global market, since it solves a most common 
problem all around the world.

APPLICABILITY OF PRODUCTs

• Problem defined above is a common issue among all the people in this modern world. And there 
were also smart devices which can provide health data of individuals commercially available in 
the global market. But in our product, we considered more health parameters for patient 
monitoring, make the product a portable and wearable device and also make health data available 
on an online platform. Therefore, our product applies to the global market.
